        <h2>What are sleep cycles?</h2>
        <p>The sleep cycle is an oscillation between the slow-wave and REM phases of sleep. It is sometimes called the ultradian sleep cycle, sleepâ€“dream cycle, or REM-NREM cycle, to distinguish it from the circadian alternation between sleep and wakefulness. In humans this cycle takes about <b>90 mins</b>. - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle'>Wikipedia</a></p>

        <h2>Sleep tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Most people take about 14 minutes to fall asleep,</li>
          <li>Increase bright light exposure during the day, </li>
          <li>Reduce blue light exposure in the evening,</li>
          <li>Don't consume caffeine late in the day,</li>
          <li>Reduce irregular or long daytime naps,</li>
          <li>Each cycle lasts roughly 90 minutes and you should pass through five or six of them each night,</li>
          <li>Waking up mid-cycle can leave you feeling grumpy and tired, that's why you should wake up in between those phases.</li>
